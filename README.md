# GIT HUB PROFILEðŸ™‚

Hello everyone!, this is my test project, I made a system using the github api where the user searches for his github name and it brings some information such as photo, bio, name, number of followers... and the repositories, when you click on repositories, it will open a screen with all the repositories detailed with name and description!

Hope you like it!
